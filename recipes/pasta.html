<h1>Description</h1>
    <div class id="desc">

    </div>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
   <div class id="ul">
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup whole roasted almonds</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup packed fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 mint leaves(optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound red cherry tomatoes or red grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound busiate pasta, or other curly shaped pasta such as <b><em>fusilli</em></b></li>
    </ul>
    </div>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class id="ol">
     <ol>
        <li>Bring about 2 cups of water to a boil, remove from heat, stir in almonds. Now let sit for <b>3 to 4 minutes</b>. Now drain, and once cool enough to handle, rub skins off with hands.</li>
        <li>Crush sliced garlic with kosher salt in a mortar and pestle into a smooth paste. Alternately, place garlic on a board and sprinkle kosher salt on top; use the flat side of the knife to flatten, mash, and scrape the garlic and salt mixture until it is a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Add peeled almonds to blender jar, followed by <b><em>cheese, basil, mint, garlic paste, oil, and tomatoes</em></b>. Add ingredients in this order, so that the almonds and cheese have a chance to grind before more wet ingredients are mixed in.</li>
        <li>Begin to pulse blender on and off until almonds and cheese are ground, then continue to pulse until remaining ingredients are incorporated. Blend on high until the pesto is as coarse or smooth as preferred.</li>
        <li>Taste for salt, and adjust. Set aside while pasta is cooking.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook busiate pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally for about <b>12 minutes</b>. Transfer pasta into a bowl with a strainer. Reserve pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add about <b>1/3</b> cup of the pasta water into the bowl, and then transfer in the pesto, along with a large pinch of salt, and toss to coat. More pasta water can be added to adjust the texture. Once mixed, add another optional handful of cheese, and toss one last time. Serve immediately.</li>
